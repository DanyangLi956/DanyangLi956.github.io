Iâ€™m a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health. Advised by Prof. Tseng, my research interests include clustering, statistical genomics, and data integration. Specifically, I have been working on spatial statistics, disease subtyping, and molecular circadian analysis. My applied experience spans breast and ovarian cancer, lung disease, substance use disorders, and electronic health record (EHR) data. 

You can find my CV in the CV page.
